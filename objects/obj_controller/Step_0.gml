/*
Notes for floor generation:
-Probably want to generate a group of blocks in a row, instead of 1-at-a-time
	*This would make it easier to include the spd variable, and generate gaps
-Could make gaps by generating where blocks should go, but then not actually creating the instance
	*Ex: System decides on a 8-block group and then a 3-block group, but doesn't create the latter group
-Or, could have separate code for blocks and gaps, and uses a boolean variable to know which code to use
	*Gap code could randomly decide a distance, then adds that to the x-value when creating the next block group
	
-The level variable (breaks the height into 16-pixel chuncks) is probably a good idea, and could be expanded
-The player's jump height should be determined, and let system use that to decide where platforms should go
	*It shouldn't generate any impossible or pixel-perfect jumps

/*
Notes for spd:
-Player's spd determines score (distance traveled?)
-Should increase gradually over time, probably has a set cap (spd_max)
-The spd should go down when player hits an obstacle (from the side)
	*Potentially when player object's x-value is more to the left than normal
	*When this happens, the counter (or whatever determines when to increase spd) should be reset
		*Ex: If spd increases every 1000 points, reduce
			score by (maybe) 3000 (then they'd need 4000 to make it go up again).
	*Also, the player's trip animation should play, and the obstacle should (probably) break/disappear
